Welcome to Doric Stacks - Installation documentation!
########################################################

Hey there! 

If you are reading this you have proabably got an installation made by Janis Lejins (http://janislejins.com) 

The purpose of this documentation is to chronicle how to install, de-install and maintain the Doric Stacks piece.

Principally the current document is so the gallery attendants on Saturday and Sunday can keep track of whether the installation is working and know what to do when it isn't. 

Sorry in advance for all the typos. Spell check will be added in Version 1.1

This section will one day detail how to install *Doric Stacks* incl server config so it will all work. It will have so much detail it will blow your brain.

############################
Running the Installed works
############################

This section will tell you how to keep the installed works running.

******************************
Main Installation Maintenance
******************************

**AKA How to Turn it on (and keep it working)**

*These directions are valid as of the afternoon of the 2/12/15 for the ANU School of art Installation only - it is really for the attendants on Saturday and Sunday morning.* 

Later Versions will inlcude steps for other venues.

**So it's Saturday and you need to turn on *Doric Stacks* here is how:**

=======================
Find the Control Panel
=======================
#. Walk into the main Doric Stacks Installation. 

	* To the left of the main body of columns is a room with a window and door. 
		* There is a computer and audio mixboard inside.

#. Open the door. 
	* Be careful of the cables.

#. On the right of the computer screen and a mix board. Under the screen there is a keyboard. 

#. First Look at the mix board.

=========================================
Monitor Performance via the audio output
=========================================

The sound of the installation is really the most obvious way to check it's health. If the sound is working and some lights are on most of the time it means everything is working. 

More importantly the viewer is more likely to think everything is working.

**Here is what to check and listen for:**

	#. On the far right side of the mix board is the master sound slider (it is probably the only slid down to zero)

	#. Slide this slider up so it is inline with the other sliders.

		* If 'normal' sounding sounds come out of the installation now the sound check is done.

	#. If the sound is totally garbled (sometimes this is momentary and fixes it's self) or non-existant it probably means that Google Chrome has crashed or is on it's way to crashing.

================================
What to do when Chrome crashes.
================================

So the installation does a lot of in browser computation and is turned on for ages.

Google Chrome isn't designed to display one webpage for 24 hours - most people only look at a webpage for 10 seconds.

Often in the mornings the system will need a Chrome reset. 

Sometimes Google Chrome garbles the sound or stops animating the installation all together. 

You should simply think this is because the memory allocation & cache for the Web Browser application exhausted.


Sometimes refreshing the webpage can work but often in the morning Chrome needs to be turned off and on again (this resets the things that need reseting)

**Here is how to fix it:**

	* First up refresh the web-page. 
		* If this makes the lights work and sounds start up again (and it doesn't sound garbled) your done. 
		* During the day it might help to refresh the webpage once or twice a day if things are getting glitchy.

	* If refreshing the web-page doesn't help the situation or sound try quitting and re-opening Chrome:

		#. Turn to the computer, using the keyboard click on the Google Chrome Icon.

		#. Quit Chrome. ( *This resets the memory allocation* )
			#. Move the cursor to the section top left of the screen,	
			#. Click on the 'Chrome' Drop Down.
			#. Click 'quit Chrome'

		#. Open Chrome Again.
			#. Click on the Chrome Icon on the bottom of the Screen

		#. Navigate to http://doricstacks.janislejins.com 
			* this might take a minute or two to load.
			* If it doesn't load try going to http://google.com to see if the internet is connected.
				
				* If Google doesn't load click on the wifi symbol in the right hand corner of the screen and make sure the computer is connected to ANU-Secure.

				* If the computer can't connect to ANU-Secure after a couple of attempts make sure you close every program and restart the computer. (There is an autostart program which *should* launch the installation see the 'How to fix everything section')

			* If Google loads but Doricstacks.janislejins.com doesn't it might mean a server somewhere in America has caught fire, or ASIO has arrested me, Or the whole internet is broken (but most likely the server is just down at the moment). 
				* You probably should call Janis.

		#. If sounds come out the speakers and some of the lights change colours your job is done.

		#. If you've tried these steps, turned the computer off and on again and are still having troubles give Janis a call.

=============================================
What to do when the Lights Stop Doing stuff.
=============================================

The lights are driven by USB Cables. Sometimes the USB protocol between the computer and the lights can fail. This results in the lights being on but theres nothing really happening. This is predominantly a software issue. The fix is use the catch all fix below and restart everything.

========================
How to fix everything..
========================

Most of the time the best way to make everything work again is to turn it off and on again. 

To do this we just restart the computer. 

I have written a program which automatically runs when the computer is turned on and does everything for you.

**Here is what to do:**

	* **Before you restart make sure you quit all the programs that are open.**

	#. Restart the computer
		#. Click on the apple icon in the top left of the screen.
		#. From the menu click Restart.
		#. The computer will restart.

	#. Once the computer restarts don't touch anything for a bit. Siri should do everything
		#. Siri will start speaking after a minute or so and she'll start tell you what she is doing.

	#. At somepoint Siri will say "I am pinging" - this is her testing the Wi-fi Connection by saying hello to google.
		* If this step fails or takes longer than 5-10 mins you can rest assured the internet is not conencting. 
		* Here you might need to click on the Wi-Fi button and click on ANU-Secure.
			* If you still can't connect call Janis.


	#. Once Siri has wifi she will open Chrome and start navigate to the installation page and say "Welcome to Doric Stacks by Janis Lejins"

		* This will take a moment to load.

		* **Make sure that only one Doric Stacks webpage is open at a time.**
			* (Sometimes if the computer hasn't been shut down properly Chrome recovers the last open page)
			* If more than one doricstacks.janislejins.com page is open close the others and refresh the page.

	#. After a while most (but not all) the lights should change colours a few times and settle into the main program.

	* **If after trying this step nothing is working the way it should still you should call Janis**

========================================================
How to do the computer at the front of the installation.
========================================================

So it seems this computer automagically restarts everynight. 

**Here is how to get it going again:**

#. Turn on the lamp.

#. There is a keyboard behind the movable wall next to the door.

#. Move the mouse.
	* This will bring the computer back from it's sleep.

#. Click on Chrome.
#. Navigate to virtualbeat.herokuapp.com
	* If it gives you an ANU portal this means the computer is connected to ANU-Access not ANU-Secure.
	* Go to the wifi icon in the top right of the screen and click on ANU-Secure
		* It may give you some prompt about certificate settings. Just click cancel.
		* If it connects to Secure try virtualbeat.herokuapp.com again.
#. Stand in front of the work and follow the prompts to let it get your hr rate.
#. Walk away.

Again if anything weird is happening just call Janis. If you can't get the computer to work and can't get in touch with me just leave that computer.

*******************************************
Do the Wall pieces (in the gallery)
*******************************************

When the track lights turn off at the end of each night so does the power to my works (my power comes from the track). There is a restart protocol.

#. Open the little door in the wall.
	* becareful of all the cabling.

#. On the power board you will see four black power supplies and a Telstra internet dongle.

#. Unplug all the black power supplies.

#. Hold down the power button on the Telstra dongle until lights come on.

#. Release the button.

#. Wait for the blue light in the middle ot come on.
	* If you have a smart phone handy check your wifi networks for one called pornhub.
	* This indicates the dongle is on and broadcasting.

#. Plug all the black power supplies back in.

	* The computers in the lights will now connect to that network.
	* It takes a few mins to start up. Go do something else and come back in a bit.

#. If the coloured lights come on your sweet. **If not do this:**
	
	#. If the lights aren't on use a phone to see if there are any new wifi networks made by the works.
		* These are called the names of the work eg "AnomalyNeedsWifi" or something similar.

	#.  If you can see this new network as well as pornhub - this means the light didn't connect to pornhub.
		* To fix this just unplug the black power adaptors and plug them in again.
		* Remember restarting takes a while so come back later.

	#. If you can't see pornhub but can see the new network:
			* turn the dongle on again. Make sure it's plugged in to it's power supply
			* Unplug and replug in all the lights
			* Remember restarting takes a while so come back later.

If after following the steps above you still can't get the lights on you can call Janis if you really really want or you can just leave it. (I'm far more concerned with the main installation working)
